### Common Tasks

**Access the application:**
- Landing page: http://localhost:3000
- Dashboard (no auth): http://localhost:3000/test-dashboard  
- Projects Management: http://localhost:3000/projects
- Interactive Map: http://localhost:3000/map (with AI detections!)
- Image Gallery: http://localhost:3000/images (with annotation access!)

- Export Data: http://localhost:3000/export (CSV/KML export!)
- Manual Annotation: http://localhost:3000/annotate/[assetId] (NEW - polygon drawing!)
- Debug Tools: http://localhost:3000/debug

**Create a new page:**
```bash
# Create new file in app/your-page/page.tsx
# Import UI components from @/components/ui/*
# Use existing color scheme: green-500, blue-500, gradients
```

**Modify database schema:**
1. Edit `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name`
3. Run `npx prisma generate`

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Green**: `green-500` to `green-600` (agriculture theme)
- **Primary Blue**: `blue-500` to `blue-600` (National Drones brand)
- **Gradients**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 to-blue-500`
- **Text Gradients**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-blue-600 bg-clip-text text-transparent`

### UI Components
All components use shadcn/ui. Import from `@/components/ui/*`:
- Button, Card, Input, Label, Select, Tabs, Toast, Dialog, etc.

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS classes only (no custom CSS)
- Maintain consistent spacing: p-4, p-6, p-8
- Cards should have hover effects: `hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow`
- Important buttons use gradient backgrounds

## 🔧 Key Algorithms & Integration Points

### Georeferencing Algorithm (lib/utils/georeferencing.ts)
The user provided a custom `pixelToGeo` function that:
- Takes drone GPS position, gimbal angles, altitude
- Converts pixel coordinates to geographic coordinates
- Accounts for terrain height, lens distortion, laser rangefinder data
- Returns latitude/longitude for detected objects

**Key parameters needed:**
- GPS coordinates (lat/lon/alt)
- Gimbal angles (pitch, roll, yaw)
- Camera parameters (focal length, sensor size)
- Laser rangefinder distance (if available)

### Roboflow Integration (TO BE IMPLEMENTED)
**API Endpoint**: https://api.roboflow.com/
**Available Models**: 
- Wattle detection
- Lantana detection
- Bellyache bush detection
- Calitropis detection

**Required for each request:**
- API key (store in .env.local as ROBOFLOW_API_KEY)
- Model version ID
- Image data (base64 or URL)

### EXIF Metadata Extraction
Using `exifr` library to extract:
- GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Altitude (absolute and relative)
- Gimbal angles (pitch, roll, yaw) from DJI drone-specific XMP tags
- Camera parameters (focal length, ISO, exposure)
- Laser rangefinder distance and target coordinates
- Image dimensions and technical metadata
- Flight timestamps and camera settings

**DJI-specific XMP namespace extraction:**
- `drone-dji:AbsoluteAltitude` - Flight altitude above sea level
- `drone-dji:GimbalPitchDegree` - Camera gimbal pitch angle
- `drone-dji:GimbalRollDegree` - Camera gimbal roll angle
- `drone-dji:GimbalYawDegree` - Camera gimbal yaw angle
- `drone-dji:LRFTargetDistance` - Laser rangefinder distance

## 🏗️ Hierarchical Project Structure

### Database Schema Design
The platform uses an enhanced project-based organization perfect for real-world agricultural operations:

```
Team
├── Project (Enhanced with location-based fields)
│   ├── name: "North Field Survey"
│   ├── location: "Smiths Farm - North Paddock" 
│   ├── purpose: WEED_DETECTION | CROP_HEALTH | SOIL_ANALYSIS | INFRASTRUCTURE | LIVESTOCK | ENVIRONMENTAL
│   ├── season: "2024 Spring" | "Winter Survey"
│   └── Assets (Images grouped by flight sessions)
│       ├── flightSession: "Flight 1 - Section A"
│       ├── flightSession: "Flight 2 - Section B"
│       └── flightSession: "Follow-up Survey"
```

### Real-world Usage Examples

**Multi-year Farm Monitoring:**
```
Location: "Smiths Farm - North Paddock"
├── Project: "2024 Spring Weed Survey" (Purpose: WEED_DETECTION)
├── Project: "2024 Summer Crop Health" (Purpose: CROP_HEALTH)  
└── Project: "2025 Winter Follow-up" (Purpose: WEED_DETECTION)
```

**Multiple Properties Management:**
```
├── Location: "Smiths Farm - North Paddock"
│   └── Project: "2024 Weed Survey"
├── Location: "Smiths Farm - South Block"  
│   └── Project: "2024 Crop Monitoring"
└── Location: "Browns Station - East Block"
    └── Project: "Infrastructure Survey"
```

### Map Filtering System
The enhanced map supports multi-level filtering:
- **Location Filter**: Filter by farm/property name
- **Project Filter**: Select specific projects
- **Purpose Filter**: Filter by survey type (weed detection, crop health, etc.)
- **Real-time Updates**: Map instantly updates with filtered results
- **Smart Statistics**: Coverage area and flight statistics update with filters

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. Tailwind CSS not working (black & white only)**
```bash
# Ensure you're using Tailwind v3, not v4
npm uninstall tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npm install tailwindcss@^3.4.15 postcss autoprefixer
```

**2. Server won't start / connection refused**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000
# Try different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
# Or kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
```

**3. Authentication errors**
- Currently auth is disabled for development
- Access dashboard directly at /test-dashboard
- To enable auth, rename `app/auth-disabled` back to `app/auth`

**4. Database errors**
```bash
# Reset database
rm prisma/dev.db
npx prisma migrate dev
```

**5. Module not found errors**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 📝 Important Notes for Future Claude Sessions

1. **User is "very limited as a developer"** - Provide complete, working solutions
2. **Batch processing is critical** - System must handle thousands of images
3. **Coordinate accuracy is paramount** - This data controls spray drones
4. **Beautiful UI is required** - Maintain green/blue theme throughout
5. **Test all code** - Run npm run lint before committing

## 🚨 Security Considerations

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all uploads** - Check file types and sizes
3. **Sanitize coordinates** - Ensure they're within valid ranges
4. **Rate limit API calls** - Especially Roboflow endpoints
5. **Secure file storage** - Set proper permissions

     teamId     String
     email      String
     role       TeamRole @default(MEMBER)
     token      String   @unique
     expiresAt  DateTime
     status     InvitationStatus @default(PENDING)
     // ... relationships
   }
   ```

4. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Phase 1: Enable authentication with middleware
   - Phase 2: Build team management UI
   - Phase 3: Implement invitation flow
   - Phase 4: Add audit logging and advanced features

### **Key Benefits**
